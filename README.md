Grisbi is an application written by French developers, so it
perfectly respects French accounting rules. Grisbi can manage multiple
accounts, currencies and users. It manages third party, expenditure
and receipt categories, budgetary lines, financial years, budget
estimates, bankcard management and other information that make Grisbi
adapted for associations.

the software is illustrated, but you can replace it by the
non-illustrated version at any time, which is available for download on
